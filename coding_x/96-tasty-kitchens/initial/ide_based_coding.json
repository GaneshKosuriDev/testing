This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.\n\nYou will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.\n\nThis is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers after your project submission.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### UI Prerequisites\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to view</summary>\n\n- What is Figma?\n  - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based.
